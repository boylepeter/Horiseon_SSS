Horiseon SSS accessability improvement. 
The following key concepts were reviewed, considered, and improved upon during refactoring of company's website. 

    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Throughout the refactoring process, accessability was improved upon with in source code, HTML and CSS were condensed and improved, to enable more readable and accessable code. All images, links, and hyperlinks were labeled and utility was ensured. 
In the future, the improvements made during refactor will enable ease of change, improvement, readability and accessability for customers as the company continues to grow.
